# Real Data Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to replace mock data with real data sources and set up admin access.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. District Statistics API (`/api/district-stats`)
- **Location**: `app/api/district-stats/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Fetches real district statistics from Supabase `district_statistics` table
  - Supports filtering by district, taluka, crop, and year
  - Returns aggregate statistics (total area, production, yield, rainfall, irrigation coverage)
  - Calculates averages across multiple records

### 2. Dashboard KPIs - Real Data Integration
- **Location**: `app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced hardcoded KPI values with real calculations from `district_statistics`
  - KPIs now show:
    - **Total Area**: Sum of area_ha from district statistics (or user's land_size from profile)
    - **Active Crops**: Count of unique crops in district statistics
    - **Average Yield**: Average yield_mt_per_ha from latest year's data
    - **Average Rainfall**: Average rainfall_mm from latest year's data
  - Automatically filters by user's district if available in their profile

### 3. CROPSAP Alerts Integration
- **Location**: `app/dashboard/DashboardClient.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced hardcoded alerts with real CROPSAP alerts from `/api/cropsap`
  - Alerts display:
    - Crop name, pest/disease information
    - District, taluka, village location
    - Severity level (high/critical = error, medium = warning, low = info)
    - Advisory recommendations
    - Reported date
  - Automatically filters by user's district if available
  - Falls back to weather alert if no CROPSAP alerts are available

### 4. Admin User Setup Guide
- **Location**: `ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- **Contents**:
  - Step-by-step instructions to get Clerk user ID
  - How to configure `ADMIN_USER_IDS` environment variable
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Security best practices

## 📊 Data Sources

### Real Data Tables (Supabase)
1. **`district_statistics`**: Maharashtra district-level agricultural statistics
   - Fields: district, taluka, crop, area_ha, production_mt, yield_mt_per_ha, rainfall_mm, irrigation_coverage_percent, etc.
   - Source: Maharashtra State Data Bank, CROPSAP

2. **`cropsap_alerts`**: Pest and disease alerts from CROPSAP
   - Fields: district, taluka, village, crop, pest, disease, severity, advisory, reported_on
   - Source: CROPSAP — Maharashtra Agriculture Department

3. **`market_prices`**: Real-time market prices
   - Source: Agmarknet API (via ingestion script)

4. **`schemes`**: Government schemes
   - Source: Manual entry via admin panel or seed scripts

5. **`crops`**: Crop encyclopedia
   - Source: Manual entry via admin panel or seed scripts

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL migration scripts in order:
\`\`\`bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor or via migration tool
scripts/007_create_cropsap_schema.sql
\`\`\`

### 2. Seed Real Data
\`\`\`bash
# Seed CROPSAP alerts (if you have real data)
pnpm seed:cropsap

# Seed district statistics (if you have real data)
pnpm seed:district
\`\`\`

### 3. Admin Access Setup
1. Get your Clerk user ID (see `ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
2. Add to `.env.local`:
   \`\`\`env
   ADMIN_USER_IDS=user_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   \`\`\`
3. Restart development server
4. Access `/admin/data` to manage schemes and crops

## 🎯 How It Works

### Dashboard Data Flow
1. **User logs in** → Profile loaded with location/district
2. **Dashboard loads** → Fetches:
   - Market prices from `/api/prices` (real Agmarknet data)
   - Weather from `/api/weather` (OpenWeatherMap/Open-Meteo)
   - CROPSAP alerts from `/api/cropsap` (filtered by district if available)
   - District statistics from `/api/district-stats` (filtered by district if available)
3. **KPIs calculated** → From district statistics aggregates
4. **Alerts displayed** → Real CROPSAP alerts with severity-based styling

### Admin Panel
- **Access**: `/admin/data` (requires Clerk auth + `ADMIN_USER_IDS`)
- **Features**:
  - Manage government schemes (CRUD)
  - Manage crop encyclopedia (CRUD)
  - View statistics from real tables

## 📝 Notes

- **No Mock Data**: All fallback mock data has been removed from API routes
- **Real Data Only**: Dashboard and APIs now rely exclusively on Supabase tables
- **District Filtering**: If user profile has location, data is automatically filtered by district
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: If no data is available, UI shows empty states or default values

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Ingest Real CROPSAP Data**: Set up automated ingestion from CROPSAP API
2. **Ingest Real District Stats**: Connect to Maharashtra State Data Bank API
3. **Expand Admin Features**: Add CRUD for CROPSAP alerts and district statistics
4. **Add More KPIs**: Calculate additional metrics from district statistics

## 🔍 Testing

To verify real data integration:
1. Sign in to the application
2. Complete onboarding (if new user) with a Maharashtra district location
3. Check dashboard KPIs - should show real district statistics
4. Check alerts section - should show real CROPSAP alerts if available
5. Check market prices - should show real Agmarknet prices

**Last Updated**: After Stage 3 completion (CROPSAP + District Statistics integration)
